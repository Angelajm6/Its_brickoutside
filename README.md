# Weather App

This weather app uses the OpenWeather API to retrieve weather data. 


## Introduction
This weather app displays the weather outlook for multiple cities for the five days of the week. I have used  [5 Day Weather Forecast](https://openweathermap.org/forecast5) to retrieve weather data for cities.

## How to use
Type the name of a city in the white box at the top and click "Search". It will automatically display the weather for that specific city during the next five days of the week.
